<title>The Keith Green Conundrum</title>
</head>
<body>

<p id='1981'>
My life was fine leaving High School. I had a stable relationship with God, so I thought, at least with the task of reading through the Bible and finding out the truth about how the world actually works by studying my Geology curricula, which was neutral to my actual faith as it existed. Any career was open up to me at that point, so I chose Geology because it included all the Physical Sciences, which I knew were not controversial. They were not controversial because I accepted Science as a given source of true knowledge, applicable to any field within Christendom. If that were not the  case, Christendom would have been considered absurd long ago, and I would not have seen it as a plausible worldview to commit to. However, my scope of knowledge was limited to that of a High School Scholar, basically neutral or positive with respect to Christianity in general. Although I was aware of some conflict between 'Science' and 'Religion' on a certain abstract level not necessarily in a covert sense, except on the issue of Origins, in which there was a heated controversy, the solution I sought was that such a conflict would be resolved by actually studying true science, basically fundamentals of reality as I knew it. I was already aware of the excesses of 'Religion,' and how the 'Church' had gone off the rails at least with the obvious failure during the Copernican Revolution, yet I thought Protestantism had separated itself from that absurdity. I was aware of contemporary 'Fundamentalism' and its absurdities, yet it was still a possibility that the Bible could be still a valid source of truth because at that time I did not realize just how ignorant I was of the nature of things in general. I knew the conflict could be induced simply by discrepancies in Biblical language and correlating it with the realities science had and continued to discover. It was this point I was convinced that Christianity as a whole still could be a plausible narrative as a whole, obscured by 'apparent' contradictions. I believed by studying the New International Version instead of the King James Version, these apparent absurdities would be more easily resolvable throughout my studies of actual science, however, I had believed that the question of Origins was an issue not completely resovlved by Science itself and it was a matter of Biblical interpretation where exactly all the contradictions existed, if they were not resolved. Yet one thing I did realize, was that Science had at least provided correct answers to physical problems where Catholicism had totally went off the rails. As a High School student, I understood that I could face the prospect of an anti-Biblical indoctrination because I became aware of 'Humanism' as an active roleplayer in the conflict. Yet I understood there were many aspects of science I was ignorant of, and many aspects of History itself which left me in a nebulous state as to what my opinion should be on such matters. It was these issues I was to resolve by going to College, not a sectarian biased school, but an actual accredited institution. I knew science would not have been adulterated by anti-Biblical bias except in specific areas where there was a conundrum of Biblical understanding primarily, and this 'Humanistic' bias which was ambient even within the Church itself. So, the real conflict was between 'Sectarianism' and 'Science' and not 'God' and 'Science.' The rhetoric of the 'Moveable Goalposts' was one thing I could always employ to maintain a pragmatic faith. In any case, this justified not 'throwing out the baby with the bathwater' and allowed room for affirmation of some form of faith not in conflict with reality itself.
</p>
<p> Bill Gothard had provided a 'Biblical' framework that I believed at least presented the Bible as a plausible foundation of actual truth and eliminated the excesses of the Evangelical Movement in general. The presentation of a lucid form of thinking was what I grasped hold of in my exposure to his holistic doctrines, which were in line with my spiritual needs at the time. Prior to that time I had a 'mystical' approach to faith like every other Evangelical, with devotional readings from Oswald Chamber's 'My Utmost For His Highest.' The standard mental conundrum with faith itself was unfalsiable, but with Gothard's Principles, my faith was falifiable using the Bible as a primary source, my attitude towards it being an indicator of my openness to God.
</p>
<p>
	Since my faith was basically validated by criteria described by Gothard, and that this was a Biblical perspective as well as typical Evangelical perspective, I was at peace with 'God' and could rely on 'God' acting not capriciously but according to intelligible principles. This way I knew at least issues concerning the basics of Salvation were not something I had to concern myself with and be overly introspective to the point of being neurotic about. I had at least a firm foundation on that particular issue which was validated. And in the context of the Bible, it would be falsifiable as any other area of knowledge. So, I also figureded that 'God' actually was 'defined' by at least the Bible in its purest manifestation apart from my subjective personal experience, which really was at best a presumption on a 'decision' to commit myself to that belief system. Any actual interaction with 'God' was contingencies manifesting themselves in my perception and emotions in relation to 'obedience' to principles laid out in the Bible and in fact Evangelical Theology in general. This type of worldview works most of the time if coupled with just some plain common sense. The absurdities come from sectarian interpretations and strange beliefs garnered from religious teachings. So my view was that at least the Bible was a stable source for falsification of any odd doctrines.
</p>
<p>
	I still maintain that the Bible in some form or another is the definition of the faith I had professed at the time, that the doctrines I had accepted would have to be true in order for any kind of faith to actually work and not be dysfunctional. What I know now is that reality doesn't necessarily adhere to theological orthodoxy, which I had once falsely believed had to be the case if the Bible was actually true.
</p>
<p>
	My opinion at this point is that the Bible, as it is, is at odds with Evangelical Theology on many points, and that this is just an eventuality. What Evangelical Theology actually is is the evolution of a mixture of Biblical interpretations and the historical stance of the Protestant Church on several fundmental issues. So, I in fact was a 'Fundamentalist' of some variety, mainly moderate enough to recognize absurdities when they were encountered. Yet the reality of it was a bias based on basic ignorance of what actually was the case on the specific issues which concerned me so much as being so important. Was Science in conflict with Faith as I had committed myself to practice it? That point is where I take offense. But I had an offense in favor of a Biblical bias that in actuality was not justified by any cogent criteria at all. My reasons for believing the Bible was intelligible was based on the lucidity of Gothard's Theology, which in fact was a form of Fundamentalism which really is insidious. But much of the accepted ubiquitous doctrines could be in some way be scaffolded by the text within the Bible. The concept that a particular version was a requirement was something I did not take seriously, as I had believed that in principle it would be contrary to 'God' actually being intelligent as a being possessing attributes of omniscience and just plain common sense. It never occurred to me that this 'God' was actually limited by Human language. This would be an idiotic contradiction to the very definition of Truth itself. And my value for Truth exceeded my value for a book. My actual faith was in a coherent doctrine of Grace, which primarily was described by Evangelical Doctrine. In my mind, the Bible was a coherent work and a valid source of knowledge, however obscured it might be by Human consumption. I believed this was sound doctrine, because lucidity was an attribute I valued. I could always shift the fact of contradiction to my own inability to understand what was actually there, not in my own language, but at least in the original language. This was no more than a 'God of the Gaps' theory applied to the existence of the Bible. I knew Science could be fallible, depending upon its state at any point in History, but the absurdity was not realizing that the Bible was immune from such things simply because of Faith and no other reason.
</p>
<p>
	So based on this consistency of values, I remain within some form of the Church which basically teaches what I have a tendencey to agree with at this time or had agreed with in the past. It is possible I am actually dealing with cognitive dissonance, yet I choose to let this play out as I believe the Truth eventually becomes self-evident over time.
</p>
<p>Coming out of High School, I believed I had credibility and integrity of mind and morals. It was moral imperfections which troubled me deeply, as they could always be manifested in certain particular situations. Natural tendencies to anger and frustration resulted in expressions of anger that were not within the parameters of a mature faith. What other weaknesses did I possess? How would they eventually come to light? They basically were sin, and as sin, subject to forgiveness. But the poing of their constant recurrence indicated I was fundamentally Human. The point is to avoid justification of inappropriate behavior because it is inappropriate behavior. So I was motivated to avoid such behavior if possible. Yet frustration would eventually occur when engaging in such activities, so gradually the activities were incised out of my life. But what I discovered is that all this frustration was actually internalized and never dealt with.
</p>
<p>
	My High School career went by with reasonable success, and so did my first 3 years in College. Yet during College was my exposure to actual issues in the Church, and adjusting by making optimal responses. Some decisions were not optimal, and others simply wrong and idiotic. By the time I left there, I had realized my faith was not a coherent as it had been thought to had been when I started. I also had learned more knowledge also, and some was disturbing. Also, experiences began to play a part in my knowledge base, and actually led to depression. Whereas in High School I saw myself as a person of relative integrity, in the context of a more real standard of integrity I fell short.
</p>
<p id='1984-1987'>By my last year at College, I was introduced to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dVw0BlJOXI" target='_blank'>Keith Green</a> and his music and theology. The effect was more introspection upon listening to the music all the time and this idea of some kind of ministry. According to Green, the ministry really needed to be in a Foreign Mission, because the US is saturated with the basics of Christianity. Also, apologetics have to be very cohesive to convince intelligent people to accept the message of the Gospel. The science I had learned by that time did not make a case consistent with any apologetic. So, my belief was to focus more on service than argumentation. Maybe the US was so resistant because of all the permutations of false Gospels and baggage associated with the Church itself? By going into a foreign field, possibly I could convince someone not immunized to the Gospel, and possibly 'God' would actually manifest himself on this endevour. Apparently, 'God' manifesting himself is contingent on receptivity to his actual existence. The US was in a stalemate between atheism and theism, so no progress could be expected from my contribution to it, as there was nothing significant that I discovered in the sciences which could be used as a convincing apologetic. Geology did not provide a convincing argument for a worldwide flood, and as it turned out, the whole field of Creationism was confounded by reality and was in the process of denialism. But a type of 'faith' still could be maintained through a 'God of the Gaps' perspective or the concept of an actual occurence of a local flood in the area. Yet some of this turned some apologetics toward something not theologically consistent with the fundamental Gospel message. If the flood wasn't worldwide, why would the Gospel need be? And why would the Bible be taken at face value? It original narrative of Creation was rendered absurd by the facts of Evolution, and could not account for biological diversity and distribution of all species on the planet. In fact, the narrative which was the foundation of the Gospel would have to be metaphorical, which pretty much negates the problem solved by it by a literal Atonement. Theology became more and more bizarre as I learned more and more. A simple message to an unreached people group could be the only way I could logically contribute to this obviously failed mission to evangelize the planet. Service could be a doorway to evangelism, but should not be contingent upon it. But service within the US would be for its own sake, because what would the message be since the population was innoculated to the absurdities of it? So I had hoped somehow to serve in a foreign mission, not prepared for such, yet figured I'd have to at least make some attempt with help from 'God.' So, there really was no specific target group in mind, and to assume one would be presumptuous. But I thought Wycliffe Bible Translators would be a field to shoot for, because I did have some computer background and such devices are a boon to the process of translation. Could Wycliffe train me into an effective ministry? As it turned out, they couldn't take me in at all for any semblance of their ministry because in the interim I had a mental breakdown which had me dependent upon medication which was an issue with travelling abroad. Maybe I had missed the call by not abandoning my education and joining the mission provided by Last Days Ministries? I had held of a year to complete the degree, and spend another year gaining a little computer background which I thought would be helpful. But I worked at a local laboratory to use my degree instead of just going despite I had no idea exactly where. Maybe I had rejected the call? Yet I knew abandoning my education would simply be idiotic, so I refused to be that simple-minded a fool to not complete what I had started. Maybe the error was not returning to the idea of missions once I had graduated? Had the 'window of opportunity' come and passed? With the breakdown, it had.
</p>
<p>
	The field of Creationism did not impress me as a valid course of graduate studies, the science was inferior and not convincing when pitted against real science as an apologetic. Also, such schools were more expensive than a normal school. But what would the point be in going, given I knew what I knew? To immerse myself in pseudoscience would not increase my credibility as an apologist for the Gospel, and actually would be no more than a diversion from actual service in the Gospel. So I did get involved in a high end prison ministry endeavor which came to my town. Yet the issue of evangelism was the responsibility of discipleship. People in prison responding to our little sales pitch on Jesus actually needed training and instruction in what they had accepted. The process of making followers of Christ really seemed to be a sloppy process and the reason why the mission had failed worldwide. How could you teach people who understood reality counterintuitive concepts without some kind of guidance? I could no more leave them with what I did than consider my own testimony a valid example of a successful conversion. They needed the tools necessary to maintain a viable faith, and here I was introducing them to a faith that had to be subject to absurdities by its very nature. I knew this from my past experience prior to an actual philosophy of faith which took years to develop. These converts were like sheep without a shepherd. And since I was the one bringing them the news, somehow I would have to be responsible for at least some rudimentary follow-up on at least what had worked for me. Yet this actually was not possible to implement.
</p>
<p id='2007'> So what I turned to was a possible career in Computer Science, which would be less controversial than Geology yet give me a chance to sort out some questions with the aid of some basic sound logic. Even if I did not come to an ephiphany on the subject, at least I would have a skill in which I could be employed to make a living and be at least a contributing part of a local church. Also, my resources could be contributed to humanitarian efforts not solely contingent on conversions for service. So I settled on the charity World Vision. In the support of a child, I felt the onus of responsibility to contribute to that child's development through contact. Yet, I did not follow through with the contact that was basically a requirement, a requirement which made me hesitant to initiate such a contribution in the first place. Yet the financial contribution was something worth doing in itself. I went through several relapses since my first mental breakdown, and several medication changes depite much resistance to dependence upon a drug to do that which I sincerely believed my faith should have been sufficient to handle. Christianity became more and more counterintuitive as time went on. Simply reading the Bible wasn't enough to justify myself as a practicing Christian, it was a matter of living by viable principles within it, despite the absurdities that also abounded in it. If I were to present a Gospel, it would have to be a lucid one. And it was bizarre how ineffective any Gospel was in the face of reality. Not only had the planet not been evangelized after 2000 years of the existence of the Church, but it had been severly corrupted by myriads of false Gospels. And who was I to say that any Gospel I presented was not also such a false one? It definitely wasn't sufficient for mental health, and if you don't have mental health, how can you have spiritual health? It would be folly for me to consider preaching such a Gospel. So that was one call I abandoned out of simple common sense. I hoped to find validation for what faith I had left, so I sought out a woman I had heard was an example of an effective faith. As it turned out, I was wrong, and ended up marrying a friend of hers just to settle with some life that wasn't pure loneliness. I could not love a foreign people group to bring them a decent Gospel, yet I could love an individual enough to demonstrate that the Gospel was true. It would have to be a simple Gospel, and lived in such a way as a child could comprehend, and possibly 'God' could manifest himself in the process in such frailty. This woman I married had suffered much and her mind was reduced to such a point as to live the same Gospel as I was now able to live. It could be said 'God' manifested during the marriage, the contingencies which came to pass did effect an improvement in her foot condition, and we endured some traumatic events in both our lives. It did not seem that much spiritual growth occurred during those 14 years, but we did maintain a functioning faith as a Christian family. We endured the loss of my shoulder in an auto accident, and returning to school to attempt a profession to replace the one I had lost, but I did not succeed at any gainful employment and found myself unemployed once again. There was no going back to my previous job which I had maintained for about eight years before the accident, since I had been terminated and the policy was not to re-hire.

<p id='2009'>
	With increasing marital strife and no prospect of employment and a dwindling bank account, the next idea I had was to try to seek some kind of revival in my personal faith along with hers. What happened instead was more dissatisfaction with my marriage and a desire to get out of it due to being 'unequally yoked,' in which I considered the marraige a 'cursed blessing' with some doctrine I had been sitting under within my church. The doctrine was one inciting ungratefulness, claiming that one's 'blessings' are 'cursed' based on some obscure Bible verses. The concept was that since my faith was less than optimum, and my obedience incomplete, I might have some similitude of happiness but in reality these were less than what I could have had if I had been fully obedient to the 'Laws of God.' So I attempted to 'return' to 'God' and likewise bring my wife to 'revival.' Yet she would have none of it, as she basically had her basic common sense intact, along with her desires for cigarettes and the life she had left behind. Within a few weeks I went insane to the point of having to be incarcerated in a lunatic asylum for a month and in the process being divorced, thus destroying any credibility I had with anything resembling faith in Christ as a family unit. I had recovered relapses before, but this time, I was 'rebooted' all the way down to my childhood. The only way 'God' manifested himself was my deliverance from what I actually believed was eternal damnation when in fact it was a month-long residence in the famous decrepit insane asylum with criminally insane convicts. All other relapses were in normal healthcare facilities, some better than others, and some with not so ominious experiences yet a near death experience. The recovery from the near death experience resulted in my description of a coherent account of my faith up to that point and my capacity to recover from it. But this bizarre trip to Hell was really something I could only survive after resignation to it and then a simple existence after deliverance from it. There were no more career goals. Yet I applied myself to losing 45 pounds I had gained after coming out of that place emaciated, the weight gain was during a period of simple recovery to life itself. I was relieved of all my responsibilities, and we all moved to Sharpsburg to start life anew.
</p>
<p id='2010-2018'>
	In Sharpsburg, I was busy with the simple life and our move here. I was renting my house and receiving an annuity from the accident which destroyed my shoulder. I volunteered at the Peachtree City Library, and went to Clayton State University Continuing Education taking courses to put me into the Film Industry. I worked for 6 months as a PA in a production of X-Men, and after that could not get any more gigs so I worked as a janitor for about 6 months until we had a family emergency and due to me abandoning my daily medication, had a seizure and had to reboot again, this time not to rise again. During my tenure as a janitor, I had learned HTML5 and CSS3 to build a webpage documenting my <a href="http://ronaldboyd.github.io/coursera-test/" target='_blank'>PA experience</a>. After recovering from the seizure, I went to 'kindergarten' again without use of my computers or smartphone, basically functioning with my 'peers' and eventually getting expelled. Only having the benefit of a counselor, I considered my life and built a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL92lVXYkG80BY0X10aKuhNCANhiuHnIhV" target='_blank'>playlist</a> on YouTube expressing my emotions and a <a href="http://ronaldboyd.github.io/coursera-test/site/protagonist/" target='_blank'>website</a> on Github with a synopsis of my childhood in graphic figures and links. I took a two-week course at Goodwill and got a second OSHA-10 Certification and a card saying I had learned to drive a forklift truck. I had some interaction with Vocational Rehabilitation but still cannot see any prospects of gainful employment now. My life is the simple life, I am just here in my current existence. We now have a worldwide pandemic, and it has really not changed my lifestyle at all.
